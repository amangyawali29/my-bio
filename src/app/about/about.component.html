      <p class="card-text">Hello, I'm Manita Regmi. I hold a Bachelor's degree in Aeronautical and Astronautical Engineering from the University of Washington, Seattle. Currently, I serve as a Design Engineer at Sekisui Aerospace, where my focus lies on crafting interior monuments and main deck cargo liners for Boeing 777 aircraft as part of the Passenger to Cargo conversion initiative.
        <br>

        Prior to my degree, during my time as a student, I gained valuable experience as an Aerospace Assembler at Bucher Aerospace. There, I specialized in refining the interiors of business and first-class sections for commercial airlines. My responsibilities included utilizing various tools to assemble premium closets, tables, and entertainment cabinets with a strong emphasis on quality. Additionally, I contributed to several design and analysis projects, enhancing my skills and expertise in the field.
      </p>
      <p class="card-text">With a comprehensive skill set spanning Autodesk Inventor, AutoCAD, CATIA V5/V6, and
        SolidWorks, I excel in engineering drafting techniques, 3D modeling, and mechanical drawing. Whether creating
        intricate designs or detailed 2D drawings, I leverage CAD software to ensure precision and accuracy in all
        aspects of my work. Additionally, my proficiency extends to simulation design using MATLAB and Simulink, as well
        as ANSYS and XFOIL, allowing me to develop robust designs and conduct thorough analysis.
        <br>
        Furthermore, I bring expertise in laboratory testing, blueprint interpretation, and simulation design, ensuring
        the viability and functionality of projects from conception to completion. With a focus on lean manufacturing
        principles and analytical thinking, I continuously seek to optimize processes and enhance efficiency in
        engineering practices. My proficiency in a diverse range of software tools, combined with a strong foundation in
        CAD techniques, positions me as a versatile and effective engineer capable of meeting and exceeding project
        requirements.</p>
